Senario: User uploads a photo to the app

TDD approach:
  Create a test for what is suposed to happen when the servers can't be reached ( Error code )
  Develop code in the phone app to display an error message when the servers can't be contacted
  Create a test for what is supposed to happen when a image isn't the correct format -> the app is supposed to convert it into a correct format
  Develop code in the app to convert the photo format to the correct format when it isn't correct in the first place
  Create a test to test for confirmation from the photo server when a user uploads a photo
  Develop the code in the phone app to the point where a user can upload a photo and recieve a success confirmation
